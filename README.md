# Udacity React Nanodegree

## Second Project : Would You Rather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template for the second project of Udacity React Nanodegree, to evaluate understanding of Redux knowledge.

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This app allow users to be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Credits

To complete this project, I read or watch the following ressources :

- [Redux Fundamentals](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview), Redux Documentation
- [Redux Essentials](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts), Redux Documentation.
- To Know more about createEntityAdapter i use to normalise my state, i read the [api documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createEntityAdapter) and watch the [createEntityAdapter tutorial of Rowadz in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zmaUSkyE1I&list=PLM0LBHjz37LW0zVaEjpeCmw-WgglfXWnI), highly recommended.
- To get a difference of Arrays (intersection of two arrays), i borrow the function in the article ["Intersection and Difference of Arrays in JavaScript"](https://usefulangle.com/post/189/javascript-array-intersection-difference)
